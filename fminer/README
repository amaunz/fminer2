 File Formats:
 =============
 Graphs are allowed in SMILES and gSpan format. This is to support both general graph mining, but to also make life more convenient when mining molecular data. For instance, for SMILES formatted input there is a switch to enable/disable aromatic ring perception, which, in gSpan format, requires re-formatting the input.
  
  SMILES file line format is defined by 
    "ID\t SMILES", e.g.:
     1    COC1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=NC(=C([NH]2)C3=CC=CC=C3)C4=CC=CC=C4

  gSpan file block format (see also: http://illimine.cs.uiuc.edu/resources/readme_plain.php?program=gSpan) is defined by:
    "t # ID" means the Nth graph,
    "v M L" means that the Mth vertex in this graph has label L,
    "e P Q L" means that there is an edge connecting the Pth vertex with the Qth vertex. The edge has label L.

- Activity file line format is defined by 
    "ID\t endpoint\t activity", e.g.:
     1    Salmonella Mutagenicity    1

 The set of IDs in a gSpan or SMILES format file must be a subset of the set of activity IDs in the respective activity format file, i.e., not every Activity ID must be matched by a graph id, but vice versa.


 Switches:
 ========
 General switches:
   Refine fragments with frequency 1.
   Enable aromatic ring perception for SMILES input.
   Insert empty vectors in result vector to indicate BBRC borders.
   Switch off output.

 Constraint parameters:
   Minimum frequency constraint, used for anti-monotonic pruning.
   Subgraph type, choices are paths and trees.
   Significance level for ground patterns.

 Constraint switches for BBRC:
   Deactivate dynamic adjustment of upper bound (less efficient; only for performance evaluation).
   Switch off mining of only the most significant/most general representative of each backbone.
   Deactivate upper bound pruning for chi-square constraint (less efficient, use only for performance evaluation).


 Environment variables:
 ======================
 Define the FMINER_SMARTS environment variable to produce output in SMARTS format (e.g. export FMINER_SMARTS=1).
 Additionally define the FMINER_LAZAR environment variable to produce output in linfrag format which can be used as input to Lazar (e.g. export FMINER_LAZAR=1).


 Remarks:
 ========
 Output consists of blocks of gSpan graphs.
 When using SMARTS output (environment variable FMINER_SMARTS), each line is a YAML sequence, containing SMARTS fragment, p-value, and two sequences denoting positive and negative class occurrences (default compound ids, see also switch -n). 
 When also FMINER_LAZAR is set, the linfrag output format is used.


 Examples:
 =========

 In any case, 1-frequent patterns are not refined further, unless you use the -s switch 

 BBRC mining:

 # BBRC representatives (min frequency 2, min significance 95%), using dynamic UB pruning
 ./fminer ../libbbrc/libbbrc.so <graphs> <activities> 
 # same as above, but much slower (explicitly no dynamic UB pruning)
 ./fminer ../libbbrc/libbbrc.so -d <graphs> <activities>                                        

 # ALL 2-frequent and 95%-significant features
 ./fminer ../libbbrc/libbbrc.so -d -b <graphs> <activities>
 # All 20-frequent patterns (frequent subgraph mining)
 ./fminer ../libbbrc/libbbrc.so -f 20 <graphs>
