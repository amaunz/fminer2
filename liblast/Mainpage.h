 *  @section sec1 Abstract
 *
 *  We present a new approach to large-scale graph mining
 *  based on so-called backbone refinement classes. The method
 *  efficiently mines tree-shaped subgraph descriptors under minimum
 *  frequency and significance constraints, using classes
 *  of fragments to reduce feature set size and running times.
 *  The classes are defined in terms of fragments sharing a common
 *  backbone. The method is able to optimize structural
 *  inter-feature entropy as opposed to occurrences, which is
 *  characteristic for open or closed fragment mining. In the
 *  experiments, the proposed method reduces feature set sizes
 *  by >90 % and >30 % compared to complete tree mining and
 *  open tree mining, respectively. Evaluation using crossvalidation
 *  runs shows that their classification accuracy is similar
 *  to the complete set of trees but significantly better than
 *  that of open trees. Compared to open or closed fragment
 *  mining, a large part of the search space can be pruned due
 *  to an improved statistical constraint (dynamic upper bound
 *  adjustment), which is also confirmed in the experiments in
 *  lower running times compared to ordinary (static) upper
 *  bound pruning. Further analysis using large-scale datasets
 *  yields insight into important properties of the proposed descriptors,
 *  such as the dataset coverage and the class size
 *  represented by each descriptor. A final cross-validation run
 *  confirms that the novel descriptors render large training sets
 *  feasible which previously might have been intractable.

 *  <a name="Installation">
 *  @section sec2 Installation
 *  LibLast is a library, written in C++. It dynamically links to OpenBabel and GSL libraries.
 *  This section describes the installation of both the library and the frontend application for Linux.
 *  @subsection ssec22 Compiling from source
 *  <b>Linux SO</b>: install development tools (gcc, g++, GNU make) and GSL as well as OpenBabel development package, then compile LibLast. On Ubuntu, you can e.g. do it like this:
 *  - Install build tools and GSL:
 *    \code
 *    apt-get install build-essential             # development tools
 *    apt-get install libgsl0-dev                 # GSL binary lib and headers
 *    \endcode
 *  - OpenBabel: follow the installation instrucations at http://openbabel.org/wiki/Install_(source_code) to build yourself after doing:
 *    \code
 *    apt-get build-dep libopenbabel-dev          # build dependencies for OB
 *    apt-get source libopenbabel-dev             # extracts OB source to the current dir
 *    \endcode
 *    or try the repository version:
 *    \code
 *    apt-get install libopenbabel-dev            # OB binary lib and headers
 *    \endcode
 *  - <a href="http://github.com/amaunz/libfminer/tree" target="_blank">Download the library source code</a> (with git: <code>git clone git://github.com/amaunz/fminer2.git</code>) and cd to <code>liblast</code> subdirectory. Use <code>./configure</code> to configure the Makefile automatically or, in the <code>Makefile</code>, adjust the include (-I) and linker (-L) flags. Run <code>make</code>.
 *  - <a href="http://github.com/amaunz/fminer/tree" target="_blank">Download the frontend code</a> (with git: <code>git clone git://github.com/amaunz/fminer2.git</code>) and cd to <code>fminer</code> subdirectory.. Use <code>./configure</code> to configure the Makefile automatically or, in the <code>Makefile</code>, adjust the include (-I) and linker (-L) flags. Run <code>make</code>.
 *  - To create this documentation with doxygen, type 'make doc'. The documentation explains API, constructor usage and options.
 *  @subsection ssec23 Language Portability
 *  The API can be made available to other languages. Follow the installation instructions above. A config file for Swig to automagically create languages bindings exists (<code>rlast_wrap.i</code>). 
 *
 *  The Makefile features a target that creates <b>ruby</b> bindings using this file. On Ubuntu, you can e.g. do this:
 *  - Use <code>./configure <version></code> to configure the Makefile automatically or, adjust the include flags (-I) in the Makefile in the line <code>INCLUDE_RB = ...</code> so that the directory contains file <code>ruby.h</code>. Also, let <code>RUBY = ...</code> point to the right ruby executable.
 *  - Run <code>make ruby</code>.

 * @section Guidance Guidance on Using (Lib)Last
 *
 * Most setting are sensible by default, see description of constructors and objects below. 
 *
 * I would suggest to manipulate the minimum frequency only at first. The number of fragments output should not be more than a multitude of the number of input graphs.
 * For most chemical databases, a minimum frequency threshold of 2%-3% will deliver good results. LibLast does not support percentage values, you will have to calculate absolute numbers to the <code>-f</code> switch first.
 *
 * @subsection Examples Examples for the frontend application
 *
 * In any case, 1-frequent patterns are not refined further, unless you use the -s switch.
 * Usage: 
 * \code
 *        ./fminer [-f minfreq] [-l type] [-s] [-a] [-o] [-n] [-r] [-d [-b [-m] | -u]] [-p p_value] <graphs> <activities>
 *        ./fminer [-f minfreq] [-l type] [-s] [-a] [-o] [-n] [-r] <graphs>
 *
 *          File formats:
 *               <graphs> File must either have suffix .smi or .gsp, indicating SMILES or gSpan format.
 *               <activities> File must be in Activity format (suffix not relevant).
 *
 *         General options:
 *               -f  --minfreq _minfreq_      Set minimum frequency. Allowable values for _minfreq_: 1, 2, ... (default: 2).
 *               -l  --level _level_          Set fragment type. Allowable values for _type_: 1 (paths) and 2 (trees) (default: 2).
 *               -s  --refine-singles         Switch on refinement of fragments with frequency 1 (default: off).
 *               -o  --no-output              Switch off output (default: on).
 *               -n  --line-nrs               Switch on line numbers in output file (default: off).
 *               -r  --bbrc-sep               Switch on BBRC separator in result vector (default: off).
 *
 *         Upper bound pruning options:
 *               -a  --aromaticity            Switch on aromatic ring perception when using smiles input format (default: off).
 *               -d  --no-dynamic-ub          Switch off dynamic adjustment of upper bound for backbone mining (default: on).
 *               -b  --no-bbr-classes         Switch off mining for backbone refinement classes (default: on).
 *               -m  --max-trees              Switch on mining for maximal trees, aka the positive border (default: off).
 *               -u  --no-upper-bound-pruning Switch off upper bound pruning (default: on).
 *               -p  --p-value _p_value_      Set significance type. Allowable values for _p_value_: 0 <= _p_value_ <= 1.0 (default: 0.95).
 * \endcode
 * There are two modes of operation, with activity information and without. BBRC mining is switched on by default. To disable it (-b), you also have to disable dynamic upper bound adjustment (-d).
 *
 * @subsection sExamples1 Use Last mining (default): 
 * \code
 * # BBRC representatives (min frequency 2, min significance 95%), using dynamic UB pruning
 * ./fminer <graphs> <activities> 
 *
 * # same as above, but much slower (explicitly no dynamic UB pruning)
 * ./fminer -d <graphs> <activities>                                        
 * \endcode
 *
 * @subsection sExamples2 Switch off BBRC mining:
 * \code
 * # all 2-frequent and 95%-significant features
 * # Note, that the -d is mandatory (no dynamic UB pruning possible here)!
 * ./fminer -d -b <graphs> <activities>
 *
 * # All 20-frequent patterns (standard frequent pattern mining)
 * ./fminer -f 20 <graphs>
 * \endcode
 *
 * <br><br>
 *  @subsection sec3 Examples using the LibLast API
 *  LibLast uses the 'singleton' design pattern known from software engineering, i.e., class instantiation is restricted to one object. To empty the database after a run to feed new compounds, use the Last::Reset() routine. 
 *
 *  The following code demonstrate the use of the Last API from C++ and ruby. It feeds a set of class-labelled molecules in SMILES format (the API currently allows no gSpan input, use the frontend application for that) and calculates a vector of fragments along with statistical relevance and occurrences and prints them out. Every root node corresponds to a single chemical element. The output consists of gSpan graphs. Define the FMINER_SMARTS environment variable to produce output in SMARTS format. In this case, each line is a YAML sequence, containing SMARTS fragment, <i>p</i>-value, and two sequences denoting positive and negative class occurrences (line numbers in Smiles file): 
 *
 *  \code
 *  - [ smarts,    p_chisq,    occ_list_active,    occ_list_inactive ]
 *  \endcode
 *
 * Documentation for YAML can be found at: http://yaml.org/spec/cvs/current.html# Additionally define the FMINER_LAZAR environment variable to produce output in linfrag format which can be used as input to <code><a href="http://lazar.in-silico.de" target="_blank">Lazar</a></code>. 
 *
 *
 * \subsubsection CPP C++
 *
 * This example uses libLast in a C++ program.
 * The example assumes that you have created the C++ library using <code>make</code>.
 *
 * \code
 * #include "last.h"
 * #include <iostream>
 * #include <string.h>
 * using namespace std;
 *
 * Last* MyFminer;
 * int main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp) {
 *   MyFminer= new Last();
 *   MyFminer->AddCompound ("COC1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=NC(=C([NH]2)C3=CC=CC=C3)C4=CC=CC=C4" , 1);
 *   MyFminer->AddCompound ("O=C1NC(=S)NC(=O)C1C(=O)NC2=CC=CC=C2" , 2);
 *      // ... continue adding compounds
 *   MyFminer->AddActivity((bool) true, 1);
 *   MyFminer->AddActivity((bool) false, 2);
 *      // ... continue adding activities (true for active, false for inactive)
 *   cerr << MyFminer->GetNoCompounds() << " compounds" << endl;
 *   // Toy example: special settings for mining all fragments
 *   MyFminer->SetChisqSig(0); // use no significance constraint
 *   MyFminer->SetRefineSingles(true); // refine structures with support 1
 *   // gather results for every root node in vector instead of immediate output
 *   MyFminer->SetConsoleOut(false);
 *   for ( int j = 0; j < (int) MyFminer->GetNoRootNodes(); j++ ) {
 *      vector<string>* result = MyFminer->MineRoot(j);
 *      for( int i = 0; i < result->size(); i++) {
 *        cout << (*result)[i] << endl;
 *      }
 *   }
 *   delete MyFminer;
 * }
 *
 *  \endcode
 *
 * \subsubsection Ruby Ruby
 *
 * This example assumes that you have created ruby bindings using <code>make ruby</code>.
 * \code
 *
 * require 'last'
 * MyFminer = Last::Last.new()
 * MyFminer.AddCompound("COC1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=NC(=C([NH]2)C3=CC=CC=C3)C4=CC=CC=C4" , 1)
 * MyFminer.AddCompound("O=C1NC(=S)NC(=O)C1C(=O)NC2=CC=CC=C2" , 2)
 *    # ... continue adding compounds
 * MyFminer.AddActivity(true, 1)
 * MyFminer.AddActivity(false, 2)
 *    # ... continue adding activities (true for active, false for inactive)
 * print MyFminer.GetNoCompounds()  
 * puts " compounds"
 * # Toy example: special settings for mining all fragments
 * # use no significance constraint
 * MyFminer.SetChisqSig(0) 
 * # refine structures with support 1
 * MyFminer.SetRefineSingles(true) 
 * # gather results for every root node in vector instead of immediate output
 * MyFminer.SetConsoleOut(false)
 * (0 .. MyFminer.GetNoRootNodes()-1).each do |j|
 *    result = MyFminer.MineRoot(j)
 *    puts "Results"
 *    result.each do |res|
 *        puts res
 *   end
 * end
 *
 *  \endcode
 *
 * \subsubsection Const Description of Constructors and Options
 * 
 * For the purpose of demonstration we used a toy database of two compounds and an unusual parameter configuration. Please note, that in general the defaults set by the standard constructor are sensible for most databases. They switch on BBRC mining with upper bound pruning for 95% significance and a minimum frequency of 2. The complete standard settings are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Minimum frequency: <b>2</b></li>
 *  <li>Feature type: <b>Trees</b></li>
 *  <li>Mine BBRCs: <b>true</b></li>
 *  <li>Dynamic upper bound: <b>true</b></li>
 *  <li>Significance level: <b>95%</b></li>
 *  <li>Console output: <b>false</b></li>
 *  <li>Aromatic perception: <b>false</b></li>
 *  <li>Refine Singles: <b>false</b></li>
 *  <li>Do Output: <b>true</b></li>
 *  <li>Separate BBRCs in output by blank line/vector: <b>false</b></li>
 *  <li>Most Specific Trees Only (Positive Border): <b>false</b></li>
 *  <li>Use line numbers instead of IDs: <b>false</b></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * \code
 *  //! Constructor for standard settings: 95% significance level, minimum frequency 2, type trees, dynamic upper bound, BBRC
 *  Last ();
 *  \endcode

 * There also exist more flexible constructors:
 * \code
 * //! Like standard constructor, but type and minimum frequency configurable
 * Last (int type, unsigned int minfreq);
 * //! Like standard constructor, but type, minimum frequency, significance level and BBRC configurable
 * Last (int type, unsigned int minfreq, float chisq_val, bool do_backbone);
 * \endcode
 * It is recommended to increase minimum frequency as a first step when too many features are generated.
