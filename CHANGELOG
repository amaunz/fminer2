Concerns: libbbrc.

1. Default behavior is now: aromatic wildcarding is switched off.
Accordingly removed environment variable FMINER_NO_AROMATIC and added FMINER_AROMATIC_WC (set to an arbitrary value to enable aromatic wildcarding).
Therefore, users that had FMINER_NO_AROMATIC *not* set will see no more aromatic wildcarding in the output.
Users that had previously set FMINER_NO_AROMATIC will still see no aromatic wildcarding.

2. Aromatic atoms are annotated with '&a' (see SMARTS documentation at http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml_tutorials/languages/smarts/index.html) to fix issue https://github.com/amaunz/fminer2/issues/closed#issue/2.
This is relevant when aromatic perception is activated (-a switch *not* set, not to be confused with aromatic wildcarding above).

Concerns: libbbrc.

1. Aliphatic atoms are annotated with '&A'. This is relevant when matching back the SMARTS fragments- when the annotation is not set, there are match positions with ambiguous cases.

Concerns: all.

1. Fminer is ready for multiple classes (http://www.maunz.de/wordpress/opentox/2011/multinomial-fminer).
2. Fminer emits pattern counts (see 'README' -> Environment Variables).
3. Extensive test suite ready (see 'test' subdirectories).
