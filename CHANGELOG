Concerns: libbbrc.

1. Default behavior is now: aromatic wildcarding is switched off.
Accordingly removed environment variable FMINER_NO_AROMATIC and added FMINER_AROMATIC (set to an arbitrary value to enable aromatic wildcarding).
Therefore, users that had FMINER_NO_AROMATIC *not* set will see no more aromatic wildcarding in the output.
Users that had previously set FMINER_NO_AROMATIC will still see no aromatic wildcarding.

2. Aromatic atoms are annotated with '&a' (see SMARTS documentation at http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml_tutorials/languages/smarts/index.html) to fix issue https://github.com/amaunz/fminer2/issues/closed#issue/2.
This is relevant when aromatic perception is activated (-a switch *not* set, not to be confused with aromatic wildcarding above).
