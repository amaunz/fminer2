Welcome to LAST (LAtent STructure Pattern Mining).

This is the LAST library, available from http://github.com/amaunz/last/tree/master.

INSTALLATION:

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/last
Note: for LAST, the switches -d -b -r are defunct.

EXAMPLE:
Mine LAST descriptors and convert output to SMARTS (see LAST README file how to use the fminer frontend binary for LAST):
./fminer -f14 ../cpdbdata/salmonella_mutagenicity/salmonella_mutagenicity_alt.smi ../cpdbdata/salmonella_mutagenicity/salmonella_mutagenicity_alt.class > salm-last.graphml

The output format is GraphML (see http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/), an XML-based file format for graphs. use last-utils to convert it to SMARTS patterns (see above).
